# hello-world
A short description.
I am a junior full stack web developer. I just completed a 6 month boot camp through Ohio State Univeristy and am beginning my first real-world project for the company I work for.

I have worked for Church Budget Envelope Comapany for a total of four years. I started out as a laborer in the production department before I was moved to a desk job where I would build dating schedules and link them to different designs for printing. After that, I was moved to file processing and then to Graphics. My boss sponsored my Bootcamp so that I could fill the role of Developer.
